## How to use GitHub

Here's how to work with GitHub.

### Pull the newest version of master branch

First you need to checkout the master and get the newest version of the source code by `git checkout master` and `git pull`.
If you're just starting out, you can use `git clone https://github.com/nghitrum/reeny.git` to clone the master branch.

### Create a new branch for your local

Create new branch by `git checkout -b name-of-branch`.

Then you can `git checkout name-of-branch`.

You can always check your local git by `git status`.

### Add all new files to your git

Use `git add .`

### Commit to git

Use `git commit -m "message should be clear and understandable"`

### Then push to branch

Use `git push -u` to find out how to push.

Then copy the result to push to your branch.

### Now check in GitHub.com

Now go to the website to check the new branch. Click on the _branch_ then _New Pull Request_ of your branch.

If it says **Able to merge**, write your message or leave it as default and click **Create pull request**.

Then if it says **This branch has no conflicts with the base branch**, you can click on **Merge pull request**, then **Confirm**.

### After merge, check out master again

Use `git checkout master`.

### If it is outdated, pull master to local

Use `git pull master`.

### Rinse and repeat
